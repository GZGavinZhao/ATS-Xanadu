Syntax for the statics of ATS3

Sorts

Sorts in ATS are for classifying static terms.
Note that types (for dynamic terms) are static terms
but not all the static terms are types. For instance,
there are static integers and static booleans in ATS,
which are predicative.

Following is a list of built-in predicative sorts in ATS:

int // for static integers
bool // for static booleans
char // for static chars
float // for static floats
string // for static strings

Following is a list of built-in imppredicative sorts in ATS:

prop // for props (which are types for proofs)
view // for views (which are types for linear proofs)
type // for types
tbox // for boxed types
tflt/tflat // for flat/unboxed types
vtype // for linear types
vtbox // for linear boxed types
vtflt/vtflat // for linear flat/unboxed types

Abstract sorts can be introduced in ATS. For instance,

abssort real // introducing an abstract sort for reals

However, introducing abstract sorts is not a feature meant
for common use; it is reserved for experts or developers of ATS.
