The Concrete Syntax of Xanadu

Author: Hongwei Xi (gmhwxi@gmail.com)

Xanadu is a programming language in the ATS family.  It is sometimes
referred to as ATS/Xanadu or simply ATS3.  Xanadu is designed to be
both a source language and a target language; it is a source for
manual program construction (by humans), and it is also a target for
automated code generation (by compilers). It is expected that various
extensions to Xanadu will be built that compile back to Xanadu itself.

The concrete syntax of Xanadu is primarily rooted in ML, and it is
also influenced by C and Lisp. In this document, please find an informal
presentation of the concrete syntax of Xanadu.
