What is ATS3?

There are many aspects in terms of what
ATS3 is.

1. Static debugging:
   Dependent types, Linear Types

2. Dynamic semantics:
   C + templates (of style of C++)

3. Extensive support for meta-programming

I have been teaching ATS2 at Boston University for about 5 years
The biggest problem I see is the VERY steep learning curve associated
with ATS2.  Very few students were able to ever overcome it to reach
the point where they could truly start enjoying the power of
(advanced) type-checking.

When I designed DML (the predecessor of ATS) nearly 20 years ago, I
employed a two-layered approach to type-checking: ML-like
type-checking first and dependent type-checking second. I abandoned
this approach in ATS. Instead, there is only dependent type-checking
in ATS1 and ATS2. In ATS3, I plan to follow DML's two-layered
approach. In particular, a program in ATS3 that passes ML-like
type-checking can be compiled and executed. So one can skip dependent
type-checking in ATS3 if one so chooses. In this way, the learning
curve is expected to be greatly leveled. But there is much more than
just leveling the learning curve.

ML-like types are algebraic. Such types are so much friendlier than
dependent types (which often involve quantifiers) for supporting
type-based meta-programming. I feel I have finally got a chance to
properly address the template selection problem that brings so much
annoyance in ATS2 (due to the use of dependent types for template
selection).

In short, ATS3 adds an extra layer to ATS2 for supporting ML-like
algebraic type-checking.  Type-based meta-programming in ATS3 solely
uses algebraic types (while aTS2 uses dependent types). ATS3 may be
initially compiled to ATS2 so as to get it going quickly.
