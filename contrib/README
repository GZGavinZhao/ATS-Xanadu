###### start of [README] ######

This is a place for contributed code.

In general, if you have a question on something
(e.g., the syntax of ATS3), please open an issue
on Github.

There is a library libxatsopt for ATS3(ATS/Xanadu).
If you create a tool for ATS3, you may want to consider
using this library (instead of relying on the source
code for ATS3).
